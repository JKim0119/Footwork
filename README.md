# Footwork

Hi all,

Whenever I don't have a practice partner but want to train for tennis, I usually do two things.

1. Practice some serves
2. Do some shadow footwork drills

One specific drill that I do for footwork is to basically play out a fake rally. One of the issues I had with this drill was that I always knew where I was going to go, so my footwork could easily compensate and make it easier (i.e going forehand to backhand to forehand to backhand, etc). I wanted to do my best to simulate a rally where I didn't know where the ball would be, [so I created this app!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jyk.footwork)

[Here's a short video of me doing a demo of the app as well!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z0YdNLd1CU)

### How does it work
There are four positions that are placed along the baseline and numbered. Since it's hard to see what is happening on your phone while doing this drill, I made it give audio cues for you to know which position to run towards. Once you run towards one of the positions, you must run back to the center of the baseline - just like in an actual rally. After a certain amount of shots, you get rest between 10-20 seconds. I set a cap of 20 seconds because that's how much time you're technically allowed to have between points.

### How to use the app

1. Toggle the positions you want to be doing the exercise for by clicking the circles with the numbers in them (number showing means on).
2. Configure the shots and points settings to your liking.
3. You can decide the weights (percentage) of each position to make one position be more likely than another position.
	- I like to personally set my weights to be more focused on my backhand because that's where I receive most of my shots
4. Give it a try!

This app doesn't have any ads or store/collect any data. I don't make any money from this at all. It's just a very simple app that I made and want to share with other tennis fans. It's currently only available for Android, but I may make a web app for this in the future depending on what people say (no iOS app because I don't wanna pay the $99/year licensing fee).
